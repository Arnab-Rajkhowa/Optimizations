Solving real world problems using mathematical optimization

Mathematical optimization refers to solving real world problems by deconstructing them using mathematical functions and accordingly solving the equations to arrive at the optimal solution.

There are 3 main parts in an optimization problem:

- Objective function (what are we trying to solve: either minimize/ maximize the function)  
- Decision variables(which are the variables that can be changed to accomodate our objective function)  
- Constraints(what are the bounds of our problem)
